                <h3>HTML</h3>
                <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It's the foundation of web pages, defining the elements that make up a page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, and more.</p>

                <h3>CSS</h3>
                <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to style and format the layout of web pages. It allows web developers to control the appearance of HTML elements, including colors, fonts, spacing, and overall page design, making the web visually appealing and user-friendly.</p>

                <h3>React</h3>
                <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily used for developing single-page applications (SPAs) and creating complex, interactive web applications with a dynamic user experience. Created by Facebook (now Meta), it simplifies the process of building UI components by making it easy to manage the state of an application and update only the necessary parts of the UI when data changes.</p>

                <h3>Node.JS</h3>
                <p>JavaScript, one of the most popular programming languages, was initially used for developing client-side web applications for a long time. Node.js enabled the development of platform-independent JavaScript applications using Google's Chrome V8 JavaScript runtime engine. Thus, Node.js opened the door for JavaScript to be used for various purposes, including server-side applications.</p>

                <p>Short for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets, SASS is a popular CSS pre-processor. SASS code is processed by the program and compiled into CSS code, which can be used to style HTML elements. SASS controls how it appears on the web page. It is compatible with all CSS versions.</p>
